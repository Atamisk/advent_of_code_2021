process: 

count segment frequencies. 
	** b determined, unique frequency
	** e determined, unique frequency
	** f determined, unique frequency

Find 1, it's the digit of length 2. 1 contains c and f. 
	** c determined. Process of elimination as we already know f
	** a determined. a has the same frequency as c and is not contained in 1. 

Find 4, it's the digit of length 4. 1 contains b,c,d,f
	** d determined, we already know b,c,f
	** g determined, we know all other letters.
